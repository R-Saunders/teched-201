## Domain Modeling
Domain modeling allows us to create a model in code for specific problems. It describes various entities and stores data in properties that encapuslate behavious in mehtods.   
## HTML Table Basics

Tables are for representing data, not for page layout. Tables are made up of various elements such as table head `thead`, table row `tr` and table data `td`.

## Introducing Constructors

Constructors allow us to set top level ojbects with their own built in methods. This makes for a very flexible and powerful way to write our code.   
Using `this` in a constructor refers to the constructor itself. Using `this` in an object literal refers to the object.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

refers to the ability to access object properties from another object. We use a JavaScript prototype to add new properties and methods to an existing object constructor. We can then essentially tell our JS code to inherit properties from a prototype. Prototypical inheritance allows us to reuse the properties or methods from one JavaScript object to another through a reference pointer function. This is very useful when we need all object in an array to have the same methods available.
