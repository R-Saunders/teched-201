## Learn HTML
### Creating Hyperlinks
To create a basic link we use the anchor element and wrap our text in `<a><a/>`.   
We then use the `href=''` attribute to add the link itself to the text.   
It is important to make our links accessible, we can do so by ensuring the text within is clear and descriptive. We can use the `tabindex=''` attribut to put them in a logical tabbing order. The main thing to add is the `title=''` attribute that will allow us to give an explanation for the link.#

## CSS Layout
### CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning
The normal flow of a document is the default positioning from the broswer with the default properties on each HTML element.   
Block level elements will follow one above the other whereas inline elements will sit side by side.   
Static, block positioning is default for every HTML element.
Absolut positioning can be beneficial when we want to place an element in a specfic place on the screen as it allows us to use the `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` CSS properties.    
Absolut positioning takes the element out of the normal flow of the document but keeps it where it is placed in the document when you scroll. Fixed positioning fixes the element in acccordance with the viewport instead of the document itself.

## Learn JS
### Functions â€“ Reusable Blocks of Code
A function declaration is where we first set up the function and the code within. Function invocation is use calling upon the function to use it and pass data through it as parameters.   
Parametrs are the data we pass through the function, arguements are the declarations in the function that allow us to use the parameters when the function is called.

## Pair Programming
### Two ways it may beenefit me.
- Greater efficiency - It would allow me to purely type code without having to look up and reference anything as the navigator will take this on and provide me with the information I need. It also allows for quicker resolutions to problems and enhanced technical skills.
- Engaged Collaboration - The coding experience becomes far more engaging and allows both people to focus better. You feel like you are being held to account and are less likely to fall prey to distractions.
