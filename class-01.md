## How the web works
The web works by sending information from data servers to other computers. Data servers are a computer designed to host content that can be served over the world wide web.
Each computer has an IP (internet protocol) address, like a postal address that allows information to be sent between addresses, an IP address lets information me sent via addresses over the web.
IP addresses are comprised of numbers seperated by dots '.' and are something that we would be silly to try and memorise to access websites and services. This is where DNS (domain name system) servers come into play.
A DNS server is like a phonebook. It will list a domain name such as www.github.com alongside it's IP address. This means when the end user wants to access github they only have to remember the domain name and the DNS server will reconcile the two.
This also helps when one computer, with one IP address, hosts multiple websites.
Information is then sent around the world using fibre optic cables, the data is sent in 'packets' from one computer to another. This is sent in binary code and is then translated back into it's original code once all packets are received.
