## Learn CSS - Flexbox

Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. This means that it allows you to arrange elements in or around each other. It is not designed for items to sit on top off each other.   
The main axis in flex box it the directed the content flows whereas the cross access is the opposite.   
Flexbox can be bage for accessibility because it alters the layout and screen readers are not good at reading in a non-linear manner.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

Flexbox can work out better than float because it allows for more concise layouts and allows text to sit next to items rather than around it.
This will make my project a lot easier to arrange the layout and repsonsiveness.
